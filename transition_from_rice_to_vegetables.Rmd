# Methodology

## Study Site

This study was conducted from April to May 2024 in West Sinjai district of Sinjai Regency, South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, located between 5°2'56" - 5°21'16" South Latitude and 119°56'30" - 120°25'33" East Longitude. Sinjai Regency is characterized by diverse geographical features, including mountainous areas that are most located in Western part of Sinjai. This area is known to have significant potential for agricultural production in South Sulawesi, including rice and vegetable crops.

## Data Source

Qualitative interviews were conducted with stakeholders to gather insights into agricultural transition practices from rice to vegetables in West Sinjai, Sinjai Regency, South Sulawesi Province Indonesia in April 2024. The respondents were selected using a snowball sampling approach, initially targeting farmers engaged in crop-shifting practices. Additional respondents were identified through referrals from initial interviewees and recommendations from agricultural extension workers. Key points such as motivations, benefits, costs, challenges, and proposed solutions were gathered during the interviews.

The respondents represented various stakeholders involved in agricultural activities within the study site, including:

# Summary of Findings

## 1. General condition

In the past, most people in West Sinjai grew local varieties of red paddy known as Taddaga, Banda’, and Lappung. In addition to that, they also cultivated tobacco, maize, and coffee. However, in the early 1990s, someone from West Java arrived in Gunung Perak village (elevation approx. 1,000-1,500 meters above sea level) to introduce vegetable farming such as potato, cabbage, carrot, and more. Eventually, he became a pioneer of vegetable farming in the area. 

It took nearly a decade for other farmers to be influenced to begin growing vegetables. Over the past 10-15 years, many farmers in the West Sinjai district, especially those in Gunung Perak and Barania villages, have transitioned their cultivation practices from traditional rice cultivation to vegetable farming. The decision of many farmers to shift to vegetables was mainly motivated by observing the success of fellow farmers in vegetable farming, demonstrating higher profitability compared to rice and other common crops such as maize and tobacco. Some farmers claimed that vegetables may yield three times higher profit than rice. 

Currently, most farmers cultivate a variety of vegetables alongside rice, while a few of them alternate between rice and vegetables on the same field. Those who continue to grow rice mainly do so for their consumption, selling only if their family’s needs are met. There is a strong social value placed on being able to produce one’s own rice, viewed as a source of pride for local people. Therefore, some farmers with multiple fields prefer to continue to grow rice as long as there is sufficient water for irrigation. 

According to the head of agricultural extension workers in West Sinjai, only a few farmers still grow local red paddy varieties (Taddaga, Banda’, and Lappung). These varieties can only be cultivated in areas with elevations of > 1,000 masl. Farmers who continue to grow these types of rice do so only for their own consumption and not for sale. This raises concerns about the potential extinction of these local varieties in the future.

Farmers residing at the lower altitude (< 700 masl) predominantly grow rice and perennial crops such as cocoa, cloves, coffee, and local fruit trees. Only a small percentage (approx. 7%) of them grow vegetables such as chili, tomato, and cucumber. Their main reason for continuing rice cultivation is the pride associated with providing their own staple food over others. They rely on the production of perennial crops and cattle farming as their main source of income.

According to farmers, there is no government intervention in their decision-making on shifting their crops from rice to vegetables. However, since the late 1990s, more farmers seem to have found greater success with vegetables. As a result, the government has officially started to provide assistance, including road infrastructure, seedling facility (Figure 7), horticulture post-harvest facility (Figure 8), and farming inputs such as seeds and fertilizers. 

According to farmers, there has not been a significant change in their consumption patterns despite shifting to vegetable crops, as they were able to purchase vegetables for their consumption needs at the market even before. However, compared to the 1990s, people claimed that the community’s consumption patterns have significantly improved, especially since vegetable cultivation began in the Gunung Perak village. Previously, people mainly consumed rice mixed with maize as their staple food due to the difficulty in accessing other foods. But with the introduction of vegetable crops in that area, the community’s diet has become much more diverse than before.

Many smallholder farmers are still involved in profit profit-sharing system known as ‘Tesang’, which refers to an arrangement between landowners and farmers to share profits from crop yields. Landowners often provide land and initial capital, while farmers handle fieldwork, crop management, and harvesting. Profits are divided based on their deal, often based on predetermined percentages or fixed shares, allowing both parties to benefit from the harvest while sharing risks and rewards. 


## 2. Issues

Most farmers mentioned that water scarcity is one of the major issues they face, especially during the dry season. In some villages such as Barania, Bontosalama, and Turungan Baji, this water scarcity poses a significant challenge for rice cultivation, especially during the dry season. Consequently, some farmers have opted to convert their rice fields into dry fields that are suitable for growing vegetables or other staple crops such as maize and peanuts. Compounding the issue, broken irrigation channels have exacerbated water scarcity over the past two years. The government, under the Ministry of Public Works and Housing, typically undertakes maintenance and repairs of the irrigation channels, which is done every five years, and the last repairs were completed in 2023. Despite these efforts, many sections remain unrepaired, leaving nearly 80 ha of rice fields unable to be irrigated. Consequently, these fields have been converted for maize and peanut cultivation. Many farmers aspire to own a water pond that can at least provide sufficient water storage for irrigating vegetable fields, especially during the dry season. However, they don’t have enough capital to construct one, and there is also limited space available in their field for such construction. 

Another issue faced by farmers is the shortage of chemical subsidized fertilizer (Urea, NPK, and ZA) that has persisted for the past two years. This shortage has forced farmers to deal with higher fertilizer costs. However, some farmers claimed that this has not significantly impacted their income, as the farmgate price of vegetables has increased, though with continued price fluctuations. Most farmers find it challenging to predict these fluctuations, as according to them, vegetable prices are heavily influenced by the supply of vegetables from other areas in Sulawesi, especially from Enrekang regency in South Sulawesi which is also known as one of the biggest vegetable producers in Sulawesi.

Furthermore, capital for vegetable cultivation has also become an issue for farmers, especially smallholder farmers. Therefore, many farmers rely on Banks for assistance by applying micro-credit program (Kredit Usaha Rakyat/KUR) for their capital. Typically, payments are made according to the harvest schedule. 


## 3. Marketing

wholesalers, retailers, or selling it themselves. Farmers often have the option to sell their vegetables directly in the fields to retailers who then resell the products in local markets or nearby regions. Many farmers find it convenient to sell their vegetables directly to retailers who visit their fields to purchase produces. These retailers often transport the vegetables to local markets or nearby areas for resale to consumers. This direct transaction allows farmers to quickly sell their products without the need for intermediaries. There are also wholesalers who purchase vegetables from local farmers and resell them to other retailers in other areas within the same province (Sulawesi) and different provinces (Kalimantan and Nusa Tenggara). The wholesalers and retailers are often women with husbands working as farmers. The prices paid to farmers are typically determined by wholesalers and retailers based on the prevailing market rates. However, in situations where the supply is limited, farmers may have more control over pricing.

As for rice, most farmers, especially those who primarily produce for their own consumption, sell their rice directly to rice mills. Upon milling their rice at these mills, farmers are required to compensate rice mills with 20 liters of rice for every 100 liters of rice they have. Afterward, the rice mills proceed to sell the rice to traders or government agencies (BULOG). Farmers who grow rice for commercial purposes sell their rice directly to traders upon milling and receiving payment in cash.

## 4. Local Farmers' groups

During the interviews, there are several local farmers’ groups in this area that I have been observed including: 

*	Farmer group (Kelompok Tani): a community-based organization that comprises small-scale farmers who come together to collaborate on various aspects of agricultural production, marketing, and community. Farmer groups serve as platforms for farmers to share knowledge, resources, and experiences, collaborate on agricultural activities such as land preparation and harvesting, access government support programs and agricultural extension services, and collectively address common challenges faced by farmers in their community.
*	Federation of farmer group (Gabungan Kelompok Tani/Gapoktan): a federation of farmers groups within the same village that serves as a coordinating body that facilitates communication and collaboration among individual farmer groups.
*	Women farmer group (Kelompok Wanita Tani/KWT): a specialized farmer group composed primarily of women engaged in agricultural activities including post-harvest management. 
* Association of farmer water users (Perkumpulan Petani Pemakai Air/P3A): a community-based organization responsible for managing water resources and irrigation systems within the village. It plays a crucial role in overseeing the distribution and allocation of water for agricultural purposes, maintaining irrigation infrastructure, resolving conflicts related to water usage, and facilitating collaboration between farmers and government agencies involved in water resource management.

All groups except for the association of farmer water users are actively guided by agricultural extension workers. Meanwhile, the association of farmer water users is actively cooperating with Farmer groups and the village government.



## 5. Government Agricultural Policies


After conducting interviews with stakeholders from the Sinjai Regency Agricultural Agency and the South Sulawesi Provincial Agricultural Agency, it is known that there is no direct intervention from the government on farmers’ decision in shifting their crops from rice to vegetables. It is also discovered that the Indonesian government prioritizes policies and programs for food crops, especially rice, as it is the main staple food for Indonesians. Consequently, most assistance provided to farmers is focused on rice cultivation, including seeds, fertilizers, irrigation, and machinery. However, starting this year, the South Sulawesi Provincial Government is focusing on developing horticultural crops, particularly breadfruit and jackfruit. Unfortunately, there is currently no specific attention given to upland vegetables by the government. Assistance for vegetable farmers exists but is limited, as the government perceives that most vegetable farmers are large-scale and less in need of support compared to most rice farmers. Due to budget constraints, the government currently focuses its assistance on nine strategic commodities that are most likely impacted by inflation including rice, chili, coffee, and cocoa. 

The Agricultural Agencies are unable to control market prices, especially for vegetables. Price regulations are typically overseen by trade agencies under the Ministry of Trade. However, for rice, the government set maximum retail price regulations to ensure affordability, considering its status as a staple food. The government provides post-harvest facilities for horticultural commodities, including warehouse and processing machinery to farmer groups to help increase the market value of their product when prices are low. On the other hand, when horticultural commodity prices increase, the government sometimes organizes “discount markets” to help consumers afford the products at more affordable prices.

# Conclusion

The transition from traditional rice cultivation to vegetable farming in the West Sinjai district, especially in Gunung Perak and Barania villages, reflects a significant shift influenced by economic factors and observations of successful fellow farmers. According to the analysis of farmers' decisions considering three options: (1) Growing rice, (2) Growing vegetables, and (3) Growing both rice and vegetables), it is found that growing vegetables only may offer higher returns and faster cash flow growth compared to other options. This appears to be the most promising option for farmers for the next decade.

While this transition has diversified farmers’ income streams and improved the local community’s diet, challenges such as water scarcity and fertilizer shortages persist, mainly impacting agricultural productivity. Additionally, the potential extinction of local red paddy varieties raises concerns about preserving agricultural biodiversity. Despite these challenges, local farmers continue to adapt by forming cooperative groups to address common issues in their farming activities. Looking ahead, sustainable solutions and government support are essential to overcome these challenges and ensure the prosperity of agricultural communities in West Sinjai.
